We are excited that EcoGazer, the solution developed by exanta for the [IFS Awards 2024](https://ifsawards.eu/) competition, won the IFS Innovation Recognition Award!

## A few words about IFS Awards

The IFS Awards aspire to solve real-world challenges through open innovation. By bringing together startups, researchers, professional teams, and individuals with novel ideas, the initiative champions collaboration, creativity, and innovation to develop sustainable solutions that benefit society. More info is available at [IFS Awards 2024 website](https://ifsawards.eu/).

## EcoGazer

Our solution tackled the challenge posed by Siemens SA to develop a mobile tenant app designed to empower residents by enhancing their understanding of energy consumption and motivating them to improve energy efficiency. EcoGazer leveraged data from Building X, Siemens' digital platform for sustainability and building performance, to provide valuable insights and tailored recommendations for tenants through advanced data analytics and AI. With features like dynamic energy consumption visualizations, gamification elements, comparisons with similar tenants, personalized goal tracking, and an LLM-powered assistant, we created a user experience that truly prioritizes tenants' needs.
