## A few words about 11th Technology Forum
In the modern economic environment, competitiveness relies upon the development of innovative products. Knowledge combined with the right technological tools is a key element in the process of developing innovative products & services. Knowledge of such tools exists in both industrial bodies (ΙCΤ & other industries) as well as in research organizations (Universities & Research Centres).

Therefore, their collaboration is important towards developing innovative products with an international perspective. In this context, 19 bodies have joined forces to organize a series of congresses under the name “Technology Forum”.
